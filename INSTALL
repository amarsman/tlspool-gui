In order to build tlspool and tlspool-gui a lot of dependencies have to be met.
At the moment the easiest way is to use NixOS packages, this will take care of 
all the dependencies and is what is used during development.

The source code in order to do so is in 3 different git repositories:
https://github.com/amarsman/nixpkgs.git branch tlspool-gui
https://github.com/amarsman/tlspool.git branch tlspool-gui
https://github.com/amarsman/tlspool-gui.git

The tlspool repository contains a script that will retrieve all other 
repositories: QUICKSTART.sh

In order for this to work you need to have git, curl and Nix installed on your
Linux distribution. Currently Debian Jessie is used for development.

See http://nixos.org/nix/manual/#chap-installation for instructions on how
to download and install Nix. It's a one-line command that will create a /nix
directory:

$ bash <(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install)

When Nix is installed do the following:

$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amarsman/tlspool/tlspool-gui/QUICKSTART.sh
$ chmod 755 QUICKSTART.sh
$ ./QUICKSTART.sh 

This will build tlspool and tlspool-gui. As it needs qt5 the build can take 
some time if you don’t have it already.

When you start the tlspool-gui it will create a tlspool-gui.ini that you need
to adapt if you don’t have the tlspool.conf file in it’s default location:

$ cat tlspool-gui.ini 
[tlspool]
configFile=/etc/tlspool.conf
