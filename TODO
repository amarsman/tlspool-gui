There are many possibilities to improve the TLS Pool GUI, some of them is
about fixing bugs, others are (ideas or potential) features:

Essential for a first version:
- select local identity dialog: default focus should be on "local identity to reveal"
- select local identity dialog: "remote pear to disclose to" should use maxlevels to show different possibilities
- command line arguments
  - --help
  - --config : specifiy the location of tlspool-gui.ini
- use status notification messages ("balloon messages")
- additional documentation
  - manual page
- improve existing documentation

Other ideas:
- verify that a system tray exists
- if there is no system tray available use a minimal application window
- order of startup of the tlspool and tlspool-gui shouldn't matter
- reconnect properly to the tlspool
- gracefully cancel threads on application exit
- finish code documentation using doxygen comments
- additional documentation
  - notes
  - end user docs
- add tests:
  - describe how you can test certain functionality (manually)
  - automate tests:
    - unit tests
    - system tests?
    - regression tests?
- valgrind
- cppcheck
- can we only log the file name excluding the build time path?
- use system logging (for real problems?)
- settings dialog
- handle the fact that there is no .git directory for the version info
- reflect the status in the system tray icon, I would like to see if
  there is a connection with the TLS Pool daemon
- NixOS: no dependency on everything in Qt5, only on the used parts
- discuss if the tlspool library can provide an async api
- verify/port to Windows
- verify/port to Windows using MXE
- verify/port to macOS
- verify/port to FreeBSD

Done:

+ added INSTALL
+ added the menu to pre select an identity to the system tray icon
+ select local identity dialog: "local identity to reveal" is now editable
+ select local identity dialog: "remember my choice" implemented
+ use tlspool_configvar to retrieve the socket name
+ tlspool-gui.ini: remove socketname
  + new TlsPoolGuiSettings class
  + removed socketname config item
  + added configFile config item
+ application settings: tlspool-gui.ini
+ log additional information
  + version
  + git commit id
+ about dialog
  + version
  + git commit id
