There are many possibilities to improve the TLS Pool GUI, some of them is
about fixing bugs, others are features e.g.:

- gracefully cancel threads on application exit
- store user selections
- finish code documentation using doxygen comments
- additional documentation
- add tests
- verify/port to Windows
- verify/port to macOS
- verify/port to FreeBSD
- use system logging (for real problems?)
- application settings
- settings dialog
- about dialog
