There are many possibilities to improve the TLS Pool GUI, some of them is
about fixing bugs, others are (ideas or potential) features:

- add the menu to pre select an identity to the system tray icon again
- use status notification messages ("balloon messages")
- store user selections
- command line arguments
  - --help
  - --config
- order of startup of the tlspool and tlspool-gui shouldn't matter
- reconnect properly to the tlspool
- gracefully cancel threads on application exit
- finish code documentation using doxygen comments
- additional documentation
  - README
  - INSTALL
  - notes
  - end user docs
  - manual page
- add tests:
  - describe how you can test certain functionality (manually)
  - automate tests:
    - unit tests
    - system tests?
    - regression tests?
- valgrind
- cppcheck
- can we only log the file name excluding the build time path?
- use system logging (for real problems?)
- settings dialog
- about dialog
- reflect the status in the system tray icon, I would like to see if
  there is a connection with the TLS Pool daemon
- NixOS: no dependency on everything in Qt5, only on the used parts
- verify/port to Windows
- verify/port to Windows using MXE
- verify/port to macOS
- verify/port to FreeBSD

Done:
+ application settings
